# Note
On p. 250 of the book, the last paragraph before Example 5.3 explains how SLT works.
So alu.tv has the contents of Table 1 from the lab specification.
I corrected the output for the SLT entries to match what is described in the book.

# TO DO
1) Fix Table 1
2) Use alu.tv as as the test file
3) Figure out how to do #1 and test it in ModelSim
4) Capture images of test waveforms
5) Some other stuff is sure to come...

6) Put errything into one PDF
